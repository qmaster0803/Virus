**Virus simulator by qmaster0803**
==============================
Hi there! Self-isolation, self-isolation...
Too boring~~
I came up with this idea (at night, of course) ^w^

This program is easy-to-setup and configurable. With it, you can create your own "virus" and watch how it works.
***
### Setup and requirements

Firstly, you need Python >= 3.7 (I prefer 3.8.1)
You can install it from official site: [Here](https://www.python.org/)

After it, you need some modules for python: opencv and matplotlib
* On Windows: open cmd.exe, type ```py -m pip install opencv-python matplotlib```
* On UNIX: open terminal, type ```sudo apt install python3-pip
```, after ```pip3 install opencv-python matplotlib```

Download .zip archive with project, unpack it to any **empty** folder and double-click on virus_sim.py
